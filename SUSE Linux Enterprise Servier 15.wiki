== Define and Describe systemd ==
  What is systemd            | * systemd is a system and session manager for Linux,
                             |   compatible with System V and LSB init scripts
                             |
                             | * systemd
                             |   * Aggressive parallelization capabilities
                             |   * on-demand daemon activation
                             |   * keeps track of processes using Linux Kernal 
                             |     Controls Groups (cgroups)
                             |   * can auto-restart failing daemons
                             |   * Logging not only of syslog messages from services,
                             |     but also messages services displayed on stdout
                             |   * Well documented in manual pages
                             |
  systemd Basics             | * Always process ID 1
                             |   * All other programs are either startded directly by
                             |     systemd or by one of its child processes
                             |   * Started directly by the Kernel
                             |   * Resists signal 9
                             |   * Replacement for System V init daemon
                             |     * Fully compatible with System V init
                             |
  Unit File                  | * A unit configuration file encodes information about
                             |   a service, a socket, a device, etc.
                             | * A manual page for each type, such as
                             |   * man systemd.service, explains the specifics of the 
                             |     respective type
                             |   * Service unit file can replace the /etc/init.d/ scripts
                             |
                             | * File name extension defines Unit type
                             | * Location: /usr/lib/systemd/system/   <-- applying service packs can overwrite
                             |             /etc/systemd/system        <-- apply changes here
