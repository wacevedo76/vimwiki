                             |    * Organize files on the disk
                             |    * Cotain files and subdirectories
                             |    * Implement the hierarchical file system
                             |  Hard Links
                             |    * Secondary file names for files on the disk
                             |    * Multiple file names referencing a sing inode
                             |    * Referenced files must reside in the same file system
                             |  Symbolic Links
                             |    * References to other files on the disk
                             |    * The inode contains a reference to another file name
                             |    * Referenced files can exist in the same file 
                             |      sytem or in other file systems
                             |    * A symbolic link can reference a non-existing
                             |      file (broken link)
                             |  Device Files
                             |    * Represent hardware (except network cards)
                             |    * Link between hardware devices and the kernel drivers
                             |    * Kernel drivers read from and write to the device file
                             |    * The kernel get the data to the actual hardware in the correct format
                             |    * Types:
                             |        * Block Devices
                             |        * Character Devices
                             |    * Created automatically by the OS (udev)
                             |
Linux Device Names for Hard  |  * 1st initialized hard drive = /dev/sda
  Hard Drives                |  * 2nd initialized hard drive = /dev/sdb ... ect
                             |  * Partition numbers are appended to the device name:
                             |
        Devce                                                 Name
        First primary partition on first hard driver          /dev/sda1
        Second primary partition or an extended partition on  /dev/sda2
        first hard driver
        First primary partition on the third hard drive       /dev/sdc1
        First logical partition on  first hard drive          /dev/sda5
        Second logical partition on first hard drive          /dev/sda6
                             |
Interprocess Communication   |  * Files used by processes to communicate with
  File                       |    each other
                             |  * Types:
                             |    * Sockets (bi-directional communication)
                             |    * Pipes/FIFOs (unidirectional communication)
