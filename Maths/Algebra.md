== Properties of Real Numbers ==
  Closure Property          | If a and b are real numbers, then:
                            |   a + b = real number
                            |   a - b = real number
                            |   ab    = real number
                            |   a / b = real number
                            |
  Commutative Property      | if a and b are real, then:
                            |   a + b = b + a
                            |   a * b = b * a
                            |
  Associative Property      | If a and b are real numbers, then:
                            |   (a + b) + c = a + (b + c)
                            |   (ab)c = a(bc)
                            |
  Distributive Property     | a(b + c) = ab + ac
                            |

  Identity                  | Within a mathematical operation, a number which
                            | when operated upon, returns the  other operand
                            |
                            | Addition/Subtraction => Identity number is 0
                            |   a + 0 = a
                            |
                            | Multiplication/Division => Identity number is 1
                            |   a * 1 = a
                            |
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Inverse                   | The inverse of addition is subtraction:
                            |  a + 1 = 2
                            |  a + (1 - 1) = 2 - 1
                            |  a           = 1
                            |
