# Geometry Notes

## Polygons
### Terms
* **Convex Polygon**:
  * A polygon such that no side extended cuts any other side or vertex; it can 
    be cut by a straight line in at most two points.  
    
    Another way of thinking about **Convex Polygons** is this: if you were to wrap a 
    rubber band around the shape in question, in physical form, the rubber band 
    would wrap around the shape completely; There would not be any space between 
    the rubber band and the shape.

* **Concave Polygon**:
  
  * Another way of thinking about **Concave Polygons** is this: if you were to wrap a 
    rubber band around the shape in question, in physical form, the rubber band 
    would wrap around the shape completely; There would not be any space between 
    the rubber band and the shape.

### Names of Shapes
| Name          | Number of sides   |
| ------------- | ----------------- |
| Triangle      | Three sided shape |
| Quadralateral | Four sided shape  |
| Pentagon      | Five sided shape  |
| Hexagon       | Six sided shape   |
| Heptagon      | Seven sided shape |
| Octagon       | Eight sided shape |
| Nonagon       | Nine sided shape  |
| Decagon       | Ten sided shape   |

### Polygonal Theorems:
  * The sum of the **exterior** angles an any polygon = **360** degrees
  * The sum of the **interior** angles of a **triangle** = **180** degrees
  * The sum of the **interior** angles of any **polygon** = **180(n - 2)**  

## Pythagorean Theorem
* The Pythagorean Theorem only applies to **right triangles** (a triangle with one right angle)
* The longest side of the right triangle is called the **Hypotinus**
* The other two sides of the right triangle are referred to as **Legs** which form a right angle.
* The Theorem is **a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> = c<sup>2</sup>** : were the Hypotinus = '**c**' and the two legs are '**a**' and '**b**'.
