#Notes from 'Modern Front-End Development for Rails - Second Edition'
##Tools used:
* **Hotwire**:
  * Keeps most of the logic on the server and communicates with client by sending HTML
  * Much of Htowire's code uses Turbo, a library for complx client-server interactions:
    * Turbo Drive - successor to Turbolinks, a way to speed up basic links.
    * Turbo Frames - easily replace pars of your page with new HTML from server
    * Turbo Streams - Arbitrary DOM replacement without custom Javascript.
