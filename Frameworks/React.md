# React JS

## Key Concepts
* React is **Declarative** not **Imperative**:
  * The DOM is interacted with and manipulated through React using React's Virtual DOM.

* Component Architecture
  * You can think of components like reusable blocks which can be using multiple times within a page, or withing a site.

* One Way Data Flow
  * Once State changes, the change is reflected in the site (interface), which simplifies where bugs may exist.

* UI Library
  * Essentially, all that react is is a UI library. It does not make any assumptions of the technology stack with is being used, making the app usable in various other environments.

### The job of a React Developer
1. Decide on Components.
2. Decide the State and where it lives.
3. What changes when state changes.
