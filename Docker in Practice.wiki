== Key Docker Commands ==
  docker build               | Build a Docker image
  docker run                 | Run a Docker image as a container
  docker commit              | Commit a Docker container as an image
  docker tag                 | Tag a Docker imager
                             |
== Options for create Docker images ==
  Docker commands / "by hand"| Fire up a container with docker run and input the
   (proofs of concepts)      | commands to create your image on the command
                             | line. Create a new image with docker commit
                             |
  Dockerfile                 | Build from a known base image, and specify the
                             | build with a limited set of simple commands
                             |
  Dockerfile and             | Same as Dockerfile, but you hand over control of
  configuration management   | the build to a more sophisticated CM tool
  (CM) tool                  |
                             |
  Scratch image and import a | From an empty image, import a TAR file with the
  set of files               | required files
                             |
== Writing a Dockerfile ==
  * Define a base image      | FROM node
  * Declare the maintainer   |   LABLE maintainer ian.miell@gmail.com
  * Clones the todo code     |   RUN git clone -q https://github.com/docker-in-practice/todo.git
  * Moves to the new cloned  |   WORKDIR todo
    directory                |
  * Runs the npm install cmd |   RUN npm install > /dev/null
  *Specifies that containers |   EXPOSE 8000
   from the built image      |
   should listen on port     |
  * Specifies which command  |  CMD ["npm","start"]
    will be run on startup   |
