== Why Do We Need a CA and TLS Certificates? ==
  The Certificate Authority  | A certificate authority (CA) is used to generate
  and Certificates           | certificates
                             |
  Certificates               | Certificates are used to confirm (authenticate)
                             | identity. They are used to prove that you are who
                             | you say you are
                             |
  Certificate Authority (CA) | A Certificate Authority provieds the ability to
                             | confirm that a certificate is valid. A certificate
                             | authority can be used to validate any certificate
                             | that was issued using that certificate authority
                             |
                             | Kubernetes uses certificates for a variety of
                             | security functions, and the different parts of
                             | our cluste rwill validate certificates using the
                             | certificate authority.
                             |
  What Certificates do we    | After the certificate authority is provisioned,
  need?                      | the following certificates will need to be
                             | generated
                             |
                             | * *Client Certificates* - These certificates provide
                             |   client authentication for varous users: admin,
                             |   kube-controller-manager, kube-proxy, kube-scheduler,
                             |   and the kubelet client on each worker node
                             |
                             | * *Kubernetes API Server Certificate* - This is the
                             |   TLS certificate for the Kubernetes API
                             |
                             | * *Service Account Key Pair* - Kubernetes uses a
                             |   certificate to sign service account tokens, so
                             |   we need to provide a certificate for that purpose
