== Installing Kubeadm, Kubelet, and Kubectl ==
  Kubeadm                    | This is a tool which automates a large portion
                             | of the process of setting up a cluster. It will
                             | make our job much easier
                             |
  Kubelet                    | The essential component of Kubernetes that
                             | handles running containers on a node. Every server
                             | that will be running containers needs kubelet
                             |
  Kubectl                    | Command-line tool for interacting with the cluster
                             | once it is up. We will use this to manage the
                             | cluster.
