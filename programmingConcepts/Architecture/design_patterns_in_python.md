# Design Patterns in Python
## General Notes (to be sorted later) 
* Design patters fall into three general catagories
  * Creational
  * Structural
  * Behavioral

## Aspects of Object-Oriented programming
### Encapsulation
* An objects state and behavior is kept hidden from the outside world.
* Objects' attributes can't be accessed directly, they must be accessed through ***getters*** and ***setters***
* In Pythong, since the **Public**, **Private** and **Protected** keywords are not available, variables and methods are prefixed with an underscore (_)
