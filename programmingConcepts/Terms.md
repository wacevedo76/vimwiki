| **What is _Composition_?**           | Composition is the idea of building classes by passing in instances of other classes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **What is _Polymorphism_?**          | If it walks and quacks like a duck, it is a duck. As long as you implement the right methods on something, then you have a polymorphic relationship                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **What does _Implementation_ mean?** | * Implementation is about defining what a function, method or class does <br>* Implementation occurs where the function, method, or class is defined.<br>* Implementation involves writing code.<br>* Implementation is done at the time of defining the function or class.                                                                       |
| **What does _Invocation_ mean?**     | * Invocation is about using a function, method, or class by calling or instantiating it.<br>* Invocation occurs wherever the function, method, or class is used in the code.<br>* Invocation involves executing or running code.<br>* Invocation happens when the program runs and the function or method is called or the class is instantiated. |
