== Serialization ==
  Serializing is the process of converting an object or data structure into a format that can be stored or
  transmitted. It is often used to save data in a file or to send it over a network.

    Examples of serialization include:

     -JSON (JavaScript Object Notation): A lightweight data-interchange format used to store and transmit data
    objects consisting of attributeâ€“value pairs and array data types.

    -XML (Extensible Markup Language): A markup language used to store and transport data.

     -YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language): A human-readable data serialization language used for data storage and
    transmission.

     -Binary Serialization: A process of converting an object into a sequence of bytes which can be persisted
    to a disk or database, or transmitted over a network connection.
