# Checking File Permissions in Linux
You can use the `os` module to check file permissions in Python.

**Example: Checking File Read/Write Permissions**
```python
import os

file_path = "sample.txt"

# Check if the file is readable
if os.access(file_path, os.R_OK):
    print(f"{file_path} is readable.")
else:
    print(f"{file_path} is not readable.")

# Check if the file is writable
if os.access(file_path, os.W_OK):
    print(f"{file_path} is writable.")
else:
    print(f"{file_path} is not writable.")
```

**Example: Using `stat` to Get File Permissions**
```python
import os
import stat

file_path = "sample.txt"
file_stat = os.stat(file_path)

# Convert mode to human-readable format
permissions = stat.filemode(file_stat.st_mode)
print(f"Permissions for {file_path}: {permissions}")
```

### Conclusion
Regular expressions provide a powerful way to process text data in files. By combining Pythonâ€™s file handling capabilities with regex, you can efficiently search, extract, and modify text. Additionally, Python allows you to execute Linux commands and check file permissions, making it a versatile tool for system administration tasks.
