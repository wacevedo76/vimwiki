Awesome ‚Äî welcome to Day 14 of your C programming journey! You're now ready to reinforce your understanding of recursion and pointers through some practical and classic exercises.

Here‚Äôs your tutorial in the format you requested:
```

## üß≠ Introduction
In today‚Äôs lesson, you‚Äôll revisit two of the most foundational and skill-reinforcing exercises in C:

* Implementing a **recursive factorial** function
* Swapping the values of two variables using **pointers**
* These exercises are often used in interviews and textbooks because they bring together key concepts like **control flow, memory management, recursion, and function parameters**.

## üìå Summary
Today you'll learn:
* How recursion works in practice (via the factorial problem)
* How to pass values by reference using pointers
* How to swap variable values through pointer manipulation
* Why recursion requires a base case and stack frames
* When to choose recursion vs. iteration

## üìò Concise Explanation of Concepts
1. Recursion
A function that calls itself to solve a smaller instance of a problem.
Used in problems with natural "repetition" or "division," like factorial or traversals.

2. Pointer-based Variable Swapping
Passing pointers to a function lets you modify the actual variables, not just copies.
Used when you want a function to change external state.

3. Base Case in Recursion
A condition that stops the recursion. Without it, the function would call itself forever and crash (stack overflow).

4. Call Stack
Each recursive call adds a frame to the call stack, holding its own local variables and state. These are unwound as the recursion returns.

## üß† Detailed Explanation
### üîÅ 1. Recursive Factorial
Factorial is defined mathematically as:

```
n! = n √ó (n - 1) √ó (n - 2) ... √ó 1
```
And recursively as:

```c
int factorial(int n) {
    if (n <= 1) return 1;       // Base case
    else return n * factorial(n - 1);  // Recursive case
}
```
Each function call pushes a new frame on the stack until the base case is reached, then they resolve backward.

### üîÑ 2. Swapping Two Variables (Pointers)
Swapping values without pointers won‚Äôt work:

```c
void swap(int a, int b) {
    int temp = a;
    a = b;
    b = temp;
}
// won't affect the originals in main!
```
Using pointers fixes this:

```c
void swap(int *a, int *b) {
    int temp = *a;
    *a = *b;
    *b = temp;
}
```
Now, you call it with:

```c
swap(&x, &y);
```
This lets you modify the original variables because you‚Äôre working with their addresses.

## üß™ Exercises
### ‚úÖ Exercise 1: Recursive Factorial
* Write a function `int factorial(int n)`
* Test it with `factorial(5)` (should return `120`)
* Add error handling for negative input

### ‚úÖ Exercise 2: Iterative Factorial (Compare)
* Write an iterative version of factorial
* Compare how recursion and iteration behave differently in terms of code and performance

### ‚úÖ Exercise 3: Pointer-based Swap
* Write a `swap(int *a, int *b)` function
* Use it in `main()` to swap two integers
* Print the variables before and after swapping to verify

### ‚úÖ Exercise 4: Swap Without a Temporary Variable (Challenge)
* Try to swap two integers using only arithmetic:

```c
*a = *a + *b;
*b = *a - *b;
*a = *a - *b;
```
* Be cautious: this works only when there‚Äôs no overflow

### ‚úÖ Exercise 5 (Bonus): Recursive Power Function
* Write `int power(int base, int exp)` using recursion
* Handle `exp = 0` as the base case
* Optionally handle negative exponents (as an advanced challenge)

## üîÑ Recap and Next Steps
### üß† What You Learned:
* How to build and trace a recursive function
* Why base cases are essential to recursion
* How to pass variables by reference with pointers
* How to use pointer arithmetic for variable manipulation

## üöÄ Next Steps:
* Day 15: Arrays and strings in depth
    * Learn how strings are managed in C using null-terminated arrays
    * Understand memory layout and character pointers
* Optional:
    * Try writing a recursive version of the Fibonacci function (or improve your old one with memoization)
    * Write a general-purpose `swap` macro or function that works with any data type
