You're doing excellent work progressing through the C course — welcome to Day 15: One-Dimensional Arrays! This is a foundational topic that will support your future learning in data structures, strings, and pointer arithmetic.

Here’s your tutorial in the format you requested:

## 🧭 Introduction
Arrays are one of the most essential data structures in C. A **one-dimensional** array is simply a list of elements of the same type stored in contiguous memory. Understanding how to define, access, and manipulate arrays will deepen your grasp of both pointers and memory layout in C — and serve as a gateway to strings, multi-dimensional arrays, and more advanced data structures.

## 📌 Summary
Today you'll learn:

1. How to declare and initialize one-dimensional arrays.
2. How to access and update elements using indices.
3. How array names relate to pointers.
4. How to iterate through arrays.
5. How to pass arrays to functions.
6. How to determine the size of an array at compile time.

## 📘 Concise Explanation
| Concept               | Description                                                     |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Array Declaration     | Reserve memory for a sequence of values of the same type.       |
| Element Access        | Use zero-based indexing with array[index].                      |
| Array Name as Pointer | array points to the first element.                              |
| Iteration             | Use for loops and pointer arithmetic to walk the array.         |
| Function Parameters   | Arrays passed to functions decay to pointers.                   |
| 'sizeof()'            | Use it at the declaration scope to find array size in elements. |

## 🧠 Detailed Explanation
1. Declaring and Initializing Arrays
```c
int arr[5];                     // uninitialized
int arr2[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};  // fully initialized
int arr3[] = {10, 20, 30};      // size inferred from initializer
```

2. Accessing and Modifying Elements
```c
Copy
arr2[0] = 42;         // set first element
printf("%d", arr2[1]);  // get second element
```
Arrays are **zero-indexed**, so the last element is arr2[4] in a 5-element array.

3. Array Name as a Pointer
The name arr2 represents a pointer to the first element:
```c
*(arr2 + 1) == arr2[1]  // pointer arithmetic and indexing are equivalent
```

4. Iterating Through Arrays
```c
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    printf("%d ", arr2[i]);
}
```
Alternatively, using pointer arithmetic:
```c
for (int *p = arr2; p < arr2 + 5; p++) {
    printf("%d ", *p);
}
```

5. Passing Arrays to Functions
```c
void printArray(int arr[], int size) {
    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
        printf("%d ", arr[i]);
    }
}
```
Arrays decay to pointers, so you must pass the size explicitly.

6. Using sizeof() to Find Array Size

```c
int arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
int size = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);
```

⚠️ This only works in the scope where the array is defined (not after it decays to a pointer).

## 🧪 Exercises
### ✅ Exercise 1: Declare and Initialize an Array
* Declare a 5-element `int` array
* Assign each element a value from `1` to `5`
* Print the elements using both index and pointer notation

### ✅ Exercise 2: Sum of Array Elements
* Write a function `int sum(int arr[], int size)` that returns the sum of all elements
* Call it with a 5-element array and print the result

### ✅ Exercise 3: Reverse Print
* Write a function that prints the array in reverse order
* Use both index and pointer-based approaches

### ✅ Exercise 4: Find Maximum Element
* Write `int findMax(int arr[], int size)`
* Return the largest element in the array

### ✅ Exercise 5 (Bonus): Modify Array In-Place
* Write a function that multiplies each element by 2
* Pass the array and its size, and modify the array in-place using pointers

## 🧠 Recap and Next Steps
### 📌 What You Learned:
* Arrays are contiguous blocks of memory storing elements of the same type
* They are zero-indexed and accessed using either array[index] or pointer arithmetic
* Arrays decay into pointers when passed to functions
* You must manage array size explicitly in C

## 🚀 Next Steps:
* Day 16: Strings in C
    * Learn how character arrays and null terminators work
    * Use standard string functions like `strlen`, `strcpy`, and `strcmp`
* Optional Challenge:
    * Write a generic `printArray()` macro using type inference (`#define` and `sizeof`)

1. Introduction

One-dimensional arrays are a foundational data structure in C. They allow you to store a sequence of elements of the same type in contiguous memory locations. Understanding arrays is essential because they are widely used in data processing, algorithm implementation, and system-level programming.

2. Summary
* What a one-dimensional array is.
* How to declare and initialize an array.
* How to access and modify elements.
* Iterating over arrays using loops.
* Common pitfalls and memory layout.

3. Concise Explanations
* **Array Definition**: An array is a collection of elements of the same type, stored in consecutive memory locations.
* **Declaration and Initialization**: Arrays can be declared with a size and optionally initialized with values.
* **Access/Modification**: Elements are accessed using zero-based indexing.
* **Looping**: `for` loops are commonly used to traverse arrays.
* **Memory**: Arrays in C do not store their size; the programmer must track it.

4. Detailed Explanations
**What is a One-Dimensional Array?**

Think of an array as a row of lockers, each with a number (index) and a value inside (data). In memory, these lockers are side-by-side.
```
int scores[5]; // Declares an array of 5 integers

Each element is stored in adjacent memory locations:
```
| index:  0 | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  |
| --------- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| value: ?? | ?? | ?? | ?? | ?? |


**Declaring and Initializing**
```
int a[3] = {10, 20, 30};
```

This creates an array with predefined values. If the number of values is less than the declared size, the remaining values are initialized to 0.

**Accessing and Modifying Elements**
```
a[1] = 99;   // Set the second element to 99
printf("%d", a[1]);  // Output: 99
```

**Looping Through an Array**
for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    printf("a[%d] = %d\n", i, a[i]);
}

This accesses each element from `a[0]` to `a[2].`

**Common Pitfalls**

* Out-of-bounds access: Accessing a[3] in an array of size 3 is undefined behavior.
* Confusion about zero-based indexing.
* Hard coding array sizes in loops.

**Metaphor**: Arrays are like train cars. You must know how many cars there are, and you can only board through clearly numbered doors.

5. Exercises

Easy

    1. Declare an array of 10 integers and set each element to its index.

6. Recap and Next Steps

You now understand what a one-dimensional array is, how to declare and initialize it, how to loop through it, and how to avoid common mistakes.
