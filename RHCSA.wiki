** Finding Files
Search for binaries in PATH  | which
Search from local db         | locate -> updatedb
General search               | find
                             | find / -name fstab  -> search by name (can use globbing)
                             | find / -type f -size +100M -> search all files larger than 100M
                             | find / -user student -> search all files owned by student
                             |
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Globbing
Glob any number of chars     | *
Glob 1 of any char           | ?
Glob 1 of a list of chars    | [hm] -> either h or m
Exclued 1 of a list of chars | [!hm] -> any char except h or m
Glob 1 of a range of numbers | [0-9] -> any number between 0 and 9
                             |
                             |

remove package               | rpm -e telent.rpm
query package                | rpm -q telnet.rpm
                             |

** Working with Linux Files - Permissions / Links
  Hard / Soft Links          | Hard Link:
                             |   * Additional name for an existing file
                             |   * Can't be created for directories
                             |   * Can't cross filesystem boundaries or partitions
                             |   * Same inode number and permissions as original file
                             |
                             | Soft Link
                             |   * Special file that points to another file
                             |   * Can be created for directories
                             |   * Can cross filesystem boundaries or partitions
                             |   * Different indoe number and file permissions than original
                             |   * Doesn't contain file data
                             |
  umask                      | The file creation mask (umask) sets permissions for new files/directories
                             | The umask is subtractive: it removes the persissioms from default permisions
                             |
                             | Default permissions for files is 666; directories are 777
                             |
                             | umask value    File Permissions    Directory Permissions
                             | 002            -rw-rw-r--          drwxrwxr-x
