  Console                    | A Console is the environment the user is looking

                             |
  Terminal                   | A Terminal is an environment that is opened on
                             | the console and provides access to a text shell,
                             | which is the command-line environment that can be
                             | used to type commands
                             |
                             | You can have multiple terminals open on a
                             | console, but you cannot have multiple consoles
                             | open in one terminal
                             |
  Virtual Terminals          | To open these terminal windows, you can use the
                             | key sequences Alt-F1 through Alt-F6
                             |
                             | *F1*: Gives access to the GNOME Display Manager

                             |
                             | A convenient alternative to using the Alt-
                             | Function key sequence is offered by the *chvt*
                             | command.

  SSH                        |
  Starting graphical apps    | There are two requirements:
  through sssh               | * An X server must be running on the client
                             |   computer. The X server is the software
                             |   component that creates the graphical
                             |   screens.
                             |
                             | * The remote host must be allowd to display
                             |   screens on the local computer
                             |

                             | -r : Synchronizes the entire directory tree
                             | -l : Also synchronizes symbolic links
                             | -p : Preserves symbolic links
                             | -n : Performs only a dry run, not actual
                             |      synchronizing anything
                             | -a : Users archive mode, thus ensuring that
                             |      entire subdirectory trees and all file
                             |      properties will be synchronized
                             | -A : Uses archive mode, and in addition
                             |      synchronizes ACLs
                             | -X : Synchronizes SELinux context as well

General search               | find
                             | find / -name fstab  -> search by name (can use globbing)

** Working with Linux Files - Permissions / Links
  Hard / Soft Links          | Hard Link:
                             |   * Additional name for an existing file
                             |   * Can't be created for directories
                             |   * Can't cross filesystem boundaries or partitions
                             |   * Same inode number and permissions as original file
                             |
                             | Soft Link
                             |   * Special file that points to another file
                             |   * Can be created for directories
                             |   * Can cross filesystem boundaries or partitions
                             |   * Different indoe number and file permissions than original
                             |   * Doesn't contain file data
                             |
  umask                      | The file creation mask (umask) sets permissions for new files/directories
                             | The umask is subtractive: it removes the persissioms from default permisions
                             |
                             | Default permissions for files is 666; directories are 777
                             |
                             | umask value    File Permissions    Directory Permissions
