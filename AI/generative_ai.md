# Generative AI
## What is Generative AI?
Generative AI is a type of Artificial Intelligence technology that can produce various types of content including text, imagery, and synthetic data.

AI is a discipline, a branch of computer science that deals with the creation of intelligent agents that can reason, and learn autonomously. It contains the subset technologies:
- **AI**
  - **Machine Learning (ML)**: A program or system that trains a model from input. ML gives computers the ability to learn without explicit programming.
    - **Supervised learning**
    - **Unsupervised learning**
    - **Reinforcement learning**
  - **Deep Learning**
    - **Discriminative**
    - **Generative**
    - **Large Language Models (LLMs)**

## Machine Learning:
Two of the most common classes of ML modles are :
- **Supervised ML models**   - Implies that data is already 'Labled'
  - In supervised learning, we are learning from past examples to predict future values.
- **Unsupervised ML models** - Implies that data is not 'labeled'
  - Unsupervised problems are all about looking at the raw data, and seeingif it naurally falls into groups.

## Deap Learning
Deep learning uses '**Artificial Neural Networks**' - allowing them to process more complex patterns than traditional machine learning.
  There are generally two types of Deep learning:
  - Discriminative:
    - Used to classify or predict.
    - Typically trained on a dataset of labled data.
    - Learns the relationship between the feaures of the dat points and the lables.
  - Generative:
    - Generates new data that is similar to data it was trained on.
    - Understands distribution of data and how likely a given example is.
    - Predicts next word in a sequence.
