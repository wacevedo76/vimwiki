# Programming Terms 
## üîç Declarative Programming ‚Äì Defined
In declarative programming, you're telling the computer what the end result should be, and leaving it to the system or language runtime to figure out how to get there.

## üÜö Declarative vs Imperative
To contrast this with imperative programming, here's a simple analogy:

| Task                | Imperative Approach                       | Declarative Approach          |
| ------------------  | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Make a cup of tea   | Boil water ‚Üí Put tea in cup ‚Üí Pour water  | "I want a cup of tea"         |
| Filter even numbers | Use a loop, check if x % 2 == 0, store it | filter even numbers from list |
| Web UI with React   | Use declarative JSX like <Button />       | As opposed to DOM APIs in JS  |

## üß† Key Characteristics
* Focuses on the result, not the process.
* Code is often more concise and readable.
* You delegate control: the underlying system handles the flow.

## ‚úÖ Examples of Declarative Paradigms
| Language/Technology | Declarative Element                            |
| SQL                 | SELECT name FROM users WHERE age > 30          |
| HTML                | <p>This is a paragraph</p>                     |
| CSS                 | color: red; font-size: 16px;                   |
| React               | Components & JSX define what UI looks like     |
| Haskell             | A pure functional, mostly declarative language |
| Prolog              | You declare facts and rules, not procedures    |

## üß™ In Practice: JavaScript Example
* Imperative (how to double numbers):

```javascript
const nums = [1, 2, 3];
const doubled = [];
for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
  doubled.push(nums[i] * 2);
}
```

* Declarative (what the result should be):
```javascript
const nums = [1, 2, 3];
const doubled = nums.map(n => n * 2);
```
In the declarative version, you say: "I want each number doubled"‚Äînot "loop through and double each number."

## üß≠ Why It Matters
Understanding declarative thinking helps you:
* Write cleaner, more maintainable code.
* Work with modern tools (like SQL, React, Terraform, Ansible, etc.)
* Shift toward higher-level abstraction and intent-focused programming.
* Would you like to see a breakdown of a specific declarative language or tool like SQL, HTML, or React?

You said:
So basically, the term Declarative simply means that the internal structure of whatever you want to do has been abstracted, making it simpler to do what you want to do?

ChatGPT said:
Yes ‚Äî that's a very good summary.

To rephrase and expand on your point:

Declarative programming abstracts away the control flow and inner mechanics, so you can focus on what you want to achieve rather than how to achieve it.
```

## üîß Let's break that down:
* Imperative style = You manually control every step.
* Like giving step-by-step driving directions.

* Declarative style = You describe your goal, and the system figures out the steps.
* Like telling a GPS your destination.

### ‚úÖ Examples in Your Words

| Task                     | Declarative Version (Your Summary)                                                 |
| Task                     | Declarative Version (Your Summary)                                                 |
| Styling a webpage        | Use CSS to say "make this red", rather than writing code that changes pixel colors |
| Querying data            | Use SQL to declare what you want: SELECT name FROM users                           |
| Creating UI              | Use React to declare how the UI should look in a state                             |
| Deploying infrastructure | Use Terraform to declare what infrastructure should exist, not how to provision it |

So yes: "Declarative" means the lower-level details are hidden or automated, and your job becomes expressing intent ‚Äî the what, not the how.
* Culture
  - Culture is defined as "the attitudes and behavior of a particular social group"
