== System Components ==
SNMP manager                 | Client software that issues SNMP requests. It's 
                             | called a manager because it's expected to extract
                             | management information from devices and issue 
                             | commands to them,
                             |
SNMP agent                   | The server running on a device such as a router, 
                             | server, or worksation. An agent is a little more 
                             | dynamic than most server software; it's expected 
                             | to be able to interrogate the local system and 
                             | provide information to the manager, and it might 
                             | even reconfigure the host if it's configured 
                             | properly.
                             |
Network magement system      | a manager that's designed to collect data and 
  (NMS)                      | issue commands to agents. It probably also runs
                             | tools for managing systems via several other 
                             | protocols. It includes programs that transform 
                             | SNMP and other data into pretty human-readable 
                             | graphs so you can make decisions.
                             |
Monitoring systems           | A server or software that runs SNMP queries and 
                             | transforms the data into human-friendly graphs
                             | and charts and tables, and/or sends alerts when 
                             | something breaksj
