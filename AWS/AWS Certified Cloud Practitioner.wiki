  Availability Zones         |
  Local Zones                |
  Edge Locations (CloudFront)|
  Wavelength                 |
  Ground Station             |

== Cloud Computing Modes ==
 Infra as a Service (IaaS)   | Contains the basic building blocks for cloud IT
                             |   Eg. VPC, EC2, EBS
                             |
 Platform as a Service (PaaS)| AWS manages the underlying infrastructure
                             |   (usually hardware and operating systems)
                             |   Eg. RDS, EMR, ElasticSearch
                             |
 Software as a Service (SaaS)| Completed product that is run and managed by the
                             |   service provider. Mostly referes to end-user
                             |   applications:
                             |     Eg, Web-based email, Office 365, Salesforce.com

== Serverless Computing ==
                             | Allows you to build and run applications and
                             | services without thinking about servers.
                             | * Also reffered to as Function-as-a-Service (FaaS)
                             |   or Abstracted services.
                             | Examples:
                             |   * Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)
                             |   * AWS Lambda
                             |   * Amazon DynamoDB
                             |   * Amazon SNS
                             |

== Cloud Computing Deployment Models ==
  Cloud                      | Fully deployed in the cloud and all parts of
                             | the application run in the cloud.
                             |
  Hybrid                     | A way to connect infrastructure and applications
                             | between cloud-based resources and existing
                             | resources that are not located in the cloud.
                             | Run AWS infrastructure and service on premises
                             | with AWS Outposts
                             |
  On-premise                 | Deploying resources on-premises, using virtualization
                             | and resource management tools, is sometimes called
                             | "private cloud"

== AWS Management Console ==
                             | * Web-based user interface to AWS
                             | * Requires an AWS account
                             | * Monitor costs
                             | * AWS Console Mobile App

== SDK & CLI Access ==
  Software Development Kits  | * Create applications tha tuse AWS services.
                             | * SDKs for Javascript, Nodejs, Java, python
                             |   .NET, PHP, Ruby, Go, C++
                             | * Moble SDKs for Android, iOS, React Native,
                             |   Unity, Xamarin
                             | * Application Programming Interface enables access
                             |   to AWS usig http calls
                             |
  Command Line Interface     | * Control multiple AWS services from the command
                             |   line and automate them through scripts
                             |
