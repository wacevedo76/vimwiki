== Ansible Architecture ==
  Ansible Inventory          | The Ansible inventory is a file or script that
                             | will provide the details about the managed nodes,
                             | including the hostname, connection methods,
                             | credentials to use and many other details
                             |
                             | It is possible to pass the inventory to Ansible
                             | using static inventory files, dynamic inventory
                             | scripts, or using the Configuration managment
                             | database (CMDB)
                             |
  Ansile Plugins             | Ansible plugins are small pieces of code that
                             | help to enable a flexible and expandable
                             | architechture.
                             |
                             | There are different types of of plugins in
                             | Ansible such as:
                             |   * Connection plugins,
                             |   * Action plugins,
                             |   * Become plugins,
                             |   * Inventory plugins
                             |
  Ansible modules            | An Ansible module is a piece of reusable and
                             | standalone script that can be used to achieve
                             | some specific tasks.
                             |

                             | standalone cripts that can be used to achieve
                             | some specific taksks. Modules provide a defined
                             | interface with options to accept arguments and
                             | return information to Ansible in JSON format.
                             |
  Ansible content collections| Ansible modules are separated from the Ansible
                             | base and distributed as *Ansible content collections*
                             | or simply *Ansible Collections*
                             |
  Ansible playbook           | The Ansible playbook is a simple file written in
                             | YAML format with the instruction list of
                             | automation tasks.
                             |

== Variables ==
  Variables are defined      | * Variable names should be letters, numbers and
  as key-value pairs         |   underscores. Tey should always start with a letter
                             |
                             | * Variables can be scoped by group, host, or
                             |   within a playbook
                             |
                             | * Variables may be passed in via command line
                             |   using the --extra-vars, the -e flag, or defined
                             |   within a playbook
                             |
                             | Examples:
                             |   ansible-playbook service.yml -e \
                             |   "target_hosts=localhost \
                             |   target_service=httpd";
                             |
                             | * Variables are referenced using double curly braces
`                             |   hosts: "{{ my_host_var }}"`
                             |
                             | # Sample Ansible Playbook1.yml
                             | -
                             |   name: Add DNS server to resolv.conf
                             |   hosts: localhost
                             |   vars:
                             |     dns_server: 10.1.250.10
                             |  tasks:
                             |     - lineinfile:
                             |         path: /etc/resolv.com
 `                            |          line: 'nameserver {{ dns_server }}'`
                             |           <-- variables are called within double brackets
                             |
  register                   | In Ansible, any play can 'register' a variable and
                             | once registered, that variable will be available
                             | to all subsequent tasks
                             |
                             | - shell: my_command_here
                             |   register: my_command_result
                             |
                             | Later, you can access stdout and stderr with
                             |   my_command_result.stdout
                             |   my_command_result.stderr
                             |
                             |
  Environment variables      | If you need to set some environment variables for
                             | your remote user accoutn, you can do that by adding
                             | lines to the remote user's .bash_provile
                             |
                             | - name: Add an environment variable to the remote user's shell
                             |   lineinfile:
                             |     dest: ~/.bash_profile
                             |     regexp: '^ENV_VAR='
                             |     line: "ENV_VAR=value'
                             |
                             | - name: Get the value of the environment variable we just added
                             |   shell: 'source ~/.bash_profile && echo $ENV_VAR'              <-- environment variables can only be used by the shell module
                             |   register: foo                                                 <-- using the register option to store the variables value
                             |
                             | - name: Print the value of the environment variable
                             |   debug:
                             |     msg: "The variable is `{{ foo.stdout }}`"                   <-- using the stored register value from the previous task
                             |
                             | Linux will also read global environment variables added to /etc/environment
                             |
                             | - name: Add a global environment variable
                             |   lineinfile:
                             |     dest: /etc/environment
                             |     regexp: '^ENV_VAR='
                             |     line: "ENV_VAR=value"
                             |   become: yes
                             |
  Per-task environment vars  | You can also set the environment for just one
                             | task, using the *environment* option for that task
                             |
                             | Example:
                             | - name: Download a file, using example-prox as a proxy
                             |   get_url:
                             |     url: http://www.example.com/file.tar.gz
                             |     dest: ~/Downloads
                             |   environment:
                             |     http_proxy: http://example-proxy:80/
                             |
                             | or you can pass an environment in va a variable in
                             | via a variable in your playbooks' *vars* secont
                             |
                             | Example:

                             | vars:

                             |     http_proxy: http://example-proxy:80/
                             |     https_proxy: https://example-proxy:443/
                             |
                             | tasks:

                             |
                             | If a proxy needs to be set system-wide (as is the
                             | case behind many corporate firewalls), it can be

                             |
                             | Example:

  When                       | One of the most helpful extr keys you can add to
                             | a play is a *when* statement. Lets take a look at
                             | a simple use of when:
                             |
                             | - yum: name=mysql-server state=present
                             |   when: (is_db_server is defined) and is_db_server
                             |
                             | *when* is even more powerful if used in
                             | conjunction with variables registered by previous
                             | tasks. As en example we want to check the status
                             | of a running application:
                             |
                             | - command: my-app --status
                             |   register: myapp_result
                             |
                             | - command: do-something-to-my-app
                             |   when: "'ready' in myapp_result.stdout"
                             |
  changed_when and           | It is difficult for Ansible to determin if a
  failed_when                | given command results in changes, so if you use
                             | the command or shell module without also using *
                             | changed_when*, Ansible will always report a
                             | change.
                             |

                             |

                             | stderr instead of stdout, so *failed_when* can be
                             | used to tell Ansible when a taks has actuall

                             | the wrong way.

== Roles ==
  An Ansible role is a collection of tasks, handlers, templates, and variables
  for configuring the target system so that it meets the desired state.
  Sample File Structure:
                             | There are only two directories required to make a
                             | working Ansible role
                             |
                             | role_name/
                             |   meta/
                             |     main.yml
                             |   tasks/
                             |     main.yaml
                             |
    Defaults/main.yml        | This contains variables for the rol that can be
                             | overwritten when the role is used
                             |
    tasks/main.yml           | This containes the main list of tasks to be
                             | executed when using the role.
                             |
    vars/main.yml            | This containes internal variables for the role.
                             |
    files                    | This contains static files that can be referenced
                             | from this role.
                             |
    templates                | This is the jinja2 templates that can be used via
                             | this role.
                             |
    Handlers/main.yml        | This contains the handler definitions
                             |
    meta/main.yml            | This defines some metadata for this role, such as
                             | the author, license, platform, and dependencies
                             |
    tests                    | This is an inventory. test.yml file that can be
                             | used to ttest this role
                             |

                             |
Roles best practices         |
  lets look a a possible file structure:
                             |
  - Ansible Project          | # Sample Ansible setup_application.yml
    * inventory.txt          | -
    * setup_application.yml  |   name: Set Firewall Configurations
    - roles                  |   hosts: web
      - webservers           |   roles:
        - files              |       - webservers
        - templates          |
        - tasks              |------------------------------------------------
        - handlers           | by seting the role "webservers"
        - vars               | all relevant files including tasks and vars
        - defaults           | in the "webservers" directory will be automatically
        - mets               | loaded
                             |
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
== Debugging ==
  *debug*                    | The debug module may be used to help troubleshoot
                             | plays:
                             |   * use to print detail information about in-progress
                             |     plays
                             |   * Handy for troubleshooting
                             |
                             | *debug* takes two primary parameters that are
                             | mutually exclusive:
                             |   * msg: A message that is printed to STDOUT
                             |   * var: A variable whose content is printed
                             |     to STDOUT
                             |
                             | Example:
                             | - debug:
                             |     msg: "System `{{ inventory_hostname }}`
                             | has uuid `{{ ansible_product_uuid }}"`
                             |
  *register*                   | The *register* module is used to store task output
                             |
                             | Several attributes are avaiable: return code,
                             | stderr, and stdout.
                             |
                             | The following play will store the results of the
                             | shell module in a variable named *motd_contents*:
                             | - hosts: all
                             |   tasks:
                             |   - shell: cat /etc/motd
                             |     register: motd_contents
                             |
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
== Handlers ==
  Handlers                   | Ansible provides a mechanism that allows an action
                             | to be flagged for execution when a task performs a
                             | change
                             |
                             | By only executing certain tasks during a change,
                             | plays are more efficient.
                             |
                             | This mechanism is known as a *handler* in Ansible
                             |
                             | A handler may be defined similarly to tasks:
                             | handlers:
                             | - name: restart memcached
                             |   service:
                             |     name: memcached
                             |     state: restarted
                             |   listen: "restart chae services""
                             |
                             | A handler may be called using the *notify* keyword:
                             | - name: template configuration file
                             |   template:
                             |     src: foo.conf
                             |     dest: /etc/foo.conf
                             |   notify:                        <-- Handler caller
                             |   - restart memcached            <-- must be the same name
                             |   - restart someotherservice     <-- can be used to call multiple handers
                             |
                             | No matter how many times a handler is flagged in a
                             | play, it only runs during a play's final phase.
                             |
                             | *notify* will only flag a handler if a task block
                             | makes changes.

                             | registered, that variable will be available to
                             | all subsequent tasks
                             |
                             | Many times, you may need to output (stdout or stderr)
                             | of a shell command, and you can get that in a
                             | variable using the following syntax:
                             |
                             | - shell: my_command_here
                             |   register: my_command_result
                             |
                             | You can now access stdout (as a string) with
                             | *my_command_result.stout* and *my_command_result.stderr*
                             |
  when                       | *when* is even more powerful if used in conjunction
                             | with variables registered by previous tasks. As an
                             | example, we want to check the status of a running
                             | application and run a play only when that app
                             | reporst it is 'ready' in its output:
                             |
                             | - command: my-app --status
                             |   regester: myapp_result
                             |
                             | - command: do-something-to-my-app
                             |   when: "'ready' in myapp_result.stdout"
                             |

== Roles ==
  File structure             | There are only wo directories required to make a
                             | working role:
                             |
                             |   role_name/
                             |     meta/

                             |
                             | If you create a directory structure like this one
                             | with a *main.yml* in each directory, Ansible will

                             | you call the role form your playbook using the
                             | following syntax:
