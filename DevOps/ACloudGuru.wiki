Defining DevOps
  DevOps                     | = Dev (Development) + Ops (Operations)
                             |
                             | Different people define DevOps in a variety of ways.
                             |
                             | This definition from Wikipedia is a good starting point
                             |
                             |   "DevOps is a software engineering culture and practice
                             |   aims at unifying software development and software
                             |   operations
                             |
                             |   DevOps aims at shorter development cycles, increased
                             |   deployment frequency, and more dependable releases,
                             |   in close alignment with busines objectives
                             |

Brief History of DevOps      |
  Agile Software Development | * DevOps grew out of the Agile software development
                             |   movement
                             | * Agile seeks to develop software in small,
                             |   frequent cycles in order to deliver
                             |   functionality to customers quickly andquickly
                             |   respond to chaning busin
                             |
                             | * DevOps and Agile often go hand-in-hand
                             |
  The Timeline of DevOps     | * 2007: Agile software development was gaining
                             |   popularity, but it was also suffering from a
                             |   growing divide between development and operations
                             |
                             | * 2007: Patrick Debois, an enginner with experience
                             |   doing both dev and ops, was doing testing on a
                             |   project and became frustrated by the huge divide
                             |   between dev and ops
                             |
                             | * 2008: Patrick Debois and Andrew Shafer met at the
                             |   Agile2008 Conference in Toronto, Canada. They
                             |   began to start conversations and seek others
                             |   interesten bridging the divide between dev and ops
                             |
                             | * June 23, 2009: John Allspawn and Paul Hammond gave
                             |   a talk to Velocity Conference: "10+ Deploys Per
                             |   Day: Dev and Ops Cooperation at Flickr." Patrick
                             |   was watching vial livestream. People began discussing
                             |   it via twiter.
                             |
                             | * October 30-31 2009: Patrick hosted the first DevOpsDays
                             |   in Ghent, Belgium; a conference for both devs and
                             |   ops engineers. The conversation continued on
                             |   Twitter:#devops
                             |
                             |
                             | * DevOps grew into an organic, grassroots movement
                             |   all over the world and spawned many tools to
                             |   support the practices valued by DevOps
                             |

Devops Essentials
  The Goals of DevOps        | Devops cultures is about collaboration between Dev and Ops
                             |
                             | Under the traditional separations between Dev and Ops
                             |   , Dev and Ops have different and opposing goals.
                             |
                             | * Development -> speed
                             | * Operations  -> Stability
                             |
                             | However, in a devOps culture
                             |   * Dev and Ops are playing on the same team
                             |   * Devn and Ops share the same goals
                             |
                             | These goals include things like:
                             |   * Fast time-to-market (TTM)
                             |   * Few production failures
                             |   * Immediae recovery from failures
                             |
                             | DevOps is a Dev and Ops working together.
                             |

Devops Essentials
  Why do build automation    | * Build automation is fast - Automation handles
                             |   tasks that would otherwis need to be done manually.
                             |
                             | * Build automation is consistent - The build happens
                             |   the same way every time, removing problems and
                             |   confusion that can happen with manual builds.
                             |
                             | * Buld automation is repeatable - The build can
                             |   be done multiple times with the same result.
                             |   Any version of the source code can always be
                             |   transformed into deployable code in a consistent way.
                             |
                             | * Buld automation is portable - The buld can be done
                             |   the same way on any machine. Anyone on the team
                             |   cab build on their macine, as well as on a shared
                             |   build server. Building code doesn't depend on specific
                             |   people or machines
                             |
                             | * Build automation is more reliable - There will be
                             |   fewer problems caused by bad builds
                             |
  What is continuous         | * Continuous Intergration(CI): the practive of frequently
  integration                |   merging code changes done by developers
                             |
                             | * Traditionally, developers would worl separately, perhaps
                             |   for weeks at a time, and then merge all of their
                             |   work together at the end in one large effort
                             |
                             | * Continuous integration mens merging constantly throughout
                             |   the day, usually with the execution of automated
                             |   tests to detect any problems caused by the merge
                             |
                             | * Merging all the time could be a lot of work, so
                             |   to avoid that it should be automated
                             |
                             |
                             |
                             |
                             |
                             |
                             |
                             |
                             |
