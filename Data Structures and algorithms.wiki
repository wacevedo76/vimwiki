  === Some common Big O run times ===
  O(long n)                  | Also known as log time, Example: Binary Search
                             | 
  O(n)                       | Also known as linear time, Example: Simple Search
                             | 
  O(n * log n)               | Example: A fast sorting algorithm, like quicksort
                             | 
  O(n**2)                    | Example: A slown sorting algorithm, like 
                             |          selection sort
                             | 
  O(n!)                      | Example: A really slow algorithm, like the

  == Tree Terminology ==
  Here is an example of a [[Tree]] node in python
  Root                       | Top node without parent
  Edge                       | A link between parent and child
  Leaf                       | A node which does not have children
  Sibling                    | Children of the same parent
  Ancestor                   | parent, grandparent, greatgrandparent... of a node
  Depth of node              | a length of the path from root to node
  Heigh of node              | a length of the path from the node to the deepest node
  Depth of tree              | depth of root node
  Height of tree             | Height of root node
                             | 
                             |
