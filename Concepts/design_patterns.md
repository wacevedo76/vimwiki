# Design Patterns

## Classifications
There are three classifications of patterns:
* Creational - How objects are created
* Structural - How objects relate to each other
* Behavioral - How objects communicate with each other

This note will describe 10 different design patters within these three classes:
* Creational
  * Singleton
  * Prototype
  * Builder
  * Factory
* Structural
  * Facade
  * Proxy
* Behavioral
  * Iterator
  * Observer
  * Mediator
  * State


## Classifications' breif description.
## Creational
  **Singleton**: 
  > A type of object with can only be instantiated once.

  **Prototype**: 
  > An alternative way of implementing inheritance, you inherit from a class which has already been created.
  
  **Builder**:  
  > Used to build an object, step by step, using methods.

  **Factory**:  
  > Use a function or a method to create an object.

## Structural  
  **Facade**:  
  > A simplified API to hide low-level details in your code base.
  
  **Proxy**:
  > Simply a substitute for an object

 ## Behavioral  
  **Iterator**:
  > Allows you to traverse through a collection of objects

  **Observer**:
  > Allows many objects to subscribe to events that are broadcast by another object. **Mediator**:  
  **State**:
  
  **Mediator**
  > Allows objects to do tasks on behalf of other objects.

  **State**
  > Determines how and object behaves based on a finite number of states
